# Fault Diagnosis Model for Early Warnings in Electrical Transformers

## General description

### Objective of the project
Develop a fault diagnosis model for electrical transformers, studying the electrical variables of the equipment through data analysis techniques, seeking to implement an efficient early warning system. This system will improve the management and energy efficiency of transformers, and will contribute significantly to the development of fault diagnosis systems in electrical systems. The effectiveness of this model will be evaluated through performance indicators, thus providing a comprehensive solution for the prevention of unscheduled events, optimization and increase in reliability of electrical networks.

### Problem to solve
Transformer failures can be caused by various factors such as overheating, short circuits, insulation problems and partial discharges. These failures, without an effective early warning system, can result in unscheduled events, affecting the continuity of the electrical supply and generating high repair costs. The developed model seeks to mitigate these problems, contributing to energy efficiency and the management of electrical transformers.

## Theoretical Foundation
Efficient management of electrical transformers is essential to ensure the reliability of electrical networks, but the lack of early warnings can lead to unscheduled events and increased repair costs. In this context, it is proposed to develop a fault diagnosis model for electrical transformers based on the analysis of electrical variables and data processing techniques. This model aims to generate early alerts that improve operational efficiency, prolong the useful life of equipment and contribute to the advancement of fault diagnosis systems in electrical networks. The expected results have a significant impact on the reliability of electrical networks, maintenance efficiency, stability of electrical systems and a reduction in operating and repair costs, with both social, economic and environmental benefits.

The detection and diagnosis of faults in electrical transformers has been a topic of interest since the beginning of electrification, and has acquired critical importance in the global electrical infrastructure. The various methods of fault detection and signal analysis applied to electrical transformers are of essential importance for research; detection and diagnosis techniques that are currently used to detect faults that can occur in transformers, which are mainly based on the most common faults of a transformer including overheating, short circuits or faults in the winding, insulation problems and partial discharges, among others (Youssef et al., 2022).

According to (Juan Z et al., 2019), among the most common failure detection methods are: i) monitoring of gases dissolved in the insulating oil, which analyzes the gases generated by failures such as hydrogen (H2), methane (CH4), acetylene (C2 H2), ethylene (C2 H4), ethane (C2 H6), carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO2) to identify incipient problems in the transformer (Lynn Hamrick, 2009); ii) infrared thermography, which detects temperature variations that may indicate overheating or contact problems in the active part of the transformer; iii) measuring electrical parameters such as current and voltage to identify imbalances or short circuits; and iv) the use of diagnostic systems based on signal processing and machine learning techniques, which can analyze complex data to detect failure patterns. Each of these methods has its advantages and limitations, and the choice of the appropriate technique depends on factors such as the precision required, the type of faults to be detected and the operating conditions of the transformer. Integrating multiple detection approaches can provide a more complete assessment of transformer health and improve the reliability of fault detection.

The diagnosis of faults in transformers has experienced an evolution towards more advanced methods that include online and offline measurements, of the aforementioned methods but they can be quite expensive to implement in distribution transformers. Some of these techniques are not suitable for dry-type transformers while others would endanger personnel (Youssef et al., 2022). Furthermore, growth has been observed in the development of online diagnostic strategies based on the monitoring of electrical variables, which offer an economical alternative to traditional methods and show significant growth potential (Meira et al., 2018). In this context, the most common failures in transformers, mainly related to insulation problems in windings and cores, underline the importance of effective diagnostic techniques to address these failures in a timely and accurate manner.

Transformer faults can be divided into two categories: developed faults, which cause damage immediately, and incipient faults, which worsen over time (Arumugam, 2021). The causes of these failures can further be classified as internal and external. Recent studies have shown that the highest failure rates are in the insulation of the transformer and among the frequent causes are due to failures in the windings/coils, as demonstrated in Figure 1 taken from (Hussain et al., 2021).

In voltage and current measurement, the relationship between the current entering the transformer and the instantaneous voltage variation between the input and output of a specific phase is analyzed (Abbasi, 2022). This analysis is considered a kind of unique identification of the transformer, allowing anomalies to be detected from their initial stages. In a healthy transformer, the graphical representation of a variation of voltage ΔV versus current (ΔV-I) can serve as this identification under both sinusoidal and non-sinusoidal operating conditions, and can be constantly compared online to detect internal faults.

In (Kang et al., 2004) they worked on a protection method for electrical transformers based on the relationship of the increments of the primary and secondary winding flux links (RIFL). This approach allows discrimination between internal faults and normal operating conditions, such as residual magnetism and overexcitation. Experimental tests were carried out that demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in various operating conditions and internal failures. The results showed a significant improvement in response time compared to conventional protection methods. Additionally, a relay prototype was successfully implemented using a digital signal processor.

The detection of internal faults in transformer windings, focusing on short-circuit faults that are critical and difficult to detect at low magnitude in terminal voltage and current signals, studied in (Asadi & Kelk, 2015) presents a new approach. efficient to diagnose the presence of incipient short circuits between turns in transformer windings. The proposed approach is based on the analysis of the phase difference between the input voltage and current in the primary winding. The novelty of the method, unlike others, is that it is applicable for different types of connections of the delta or star winding. This paper argues that such an approach provides an effective and encouraging alternative for the detection of internal faults in the windings of small power and distribution transformers, even at early stages of the fault.

In (Masoum et al., 2017) I investigate the effectiveness of a recently proposed method for online detection of internal faults in transformers and examine the impact of harmonics through a detailed nonlinear simulation of a transformer using finite element modeling. three-dimensional. The proposed online technique is based on considering the correlation between the instantaneous input and output voltage difference (ΔV) and the input current of a particular phase as a fingerprint of the transformer that could be measured in each cycle to identify any incipient mechanical deformation. inside the transformers. In conclusion, this method can identify and qualify internal failures of the transformer in operating conditions that, unlike other conventional methods, do not require taking the transformer out of service. However, its application to practical three-phase power transformers has not been explored and requires more. investigation.
